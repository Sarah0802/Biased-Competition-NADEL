This repository provides the code for fitting the parameter value, and predicting biological/physical quantity evolutions in the model for the non-linear manipulation and analysis of large DNA datasets (we will provide the link for the paper later on). 

In specific, 

decodeing NGS.py and Code assignment.py are python code which extracts DNA sequence count from raw data.

data_fitting_XXX.m calculates the optimal value for the model parameter. 

data_prediction_for_input_data_and_calculated_alpha.m is able to predict the results with given model parameter value, and compare it with exprimental data. 

data_XXX_library_XXX.m provide the expriments data analyzed in the paper.
